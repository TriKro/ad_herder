Tracking Twitter conversions (this only tracks people who click on follow and weren't already following you):
1. Start by creating your follow button at http://twitter.com/about/resources/followbutton
2. Create a new call to action and switch the editor to HTML mode
3. Paste the Twitter follow button code from step 1
4. Save the call
5. Find the ID of the call. You can do this on the reports page or in the URL of the edit page (/wp-admin/post.php?post=<call-id>)
6. Below this, add the following:
---
<script type="text/javascript">
twttr.events.bind('follow', function(event) {
  ctopt_track("http://<blog-url>/<blog-path>/?ctopt_track=<call-id>");
});
</script>
---
In the URL you'll need to replace the URL with your blog url and the call-id with the id of the call.
7. Update and you're done
